# Grandma's Cookbook

Grandma's Cookbook is a web application designed to assist users in storing their most memorable recipes. Anyone can view recipes created within the database, but Google OAuth is required to gain access to create, edit and delete functionalities. Users are able to store in the database the ingredients they would like to use for a recipe. When creating a recipe the user adds the ingredients that were made, provides cooking instructions and even has the ability to comment on and rate recipes. Any user can comment on a recipe, but only the user that created the recipe may delete comments.

The deployed web application can be found [here].
